<p>It looks like info about the tool itself doesn&#8217;t exist in its database. May stick to widely known topics.<br><br>First bits:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Hubble.ai is an innovative tool that is revolutionizing the way companies conduct meetings and analyze team dynamics. This cutting-edge technology uses artificial intelligence to provide real-time insights and suggestions to improve communication, collaboration, and productivity within teams.

<p><strong>Prompt:</strong> Core ideas from arthur schopenhauer</p>



<p>First bits:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>Arthur Schopenhauer was a German philosopher who is known for his pessimistic view on life and his unique perspective on human existence. He is considered one of the most important philosophers of the 19th century and his ideas have had a significant influence on Western philosophy. One of the core ideas of Schopenhauer&#8217;s philosophy is the concept of the will. He believed that the will is the driving force behind all human actions and desires. According to Schopenhauer, the will is an irrational and blind force that governs human behavior and leads to suffering and unhappiness. </p>
