<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Text To Music feature tested: works well</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="696" height="952" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-3.png" alt="text to music function of musicfy.lol" class="wp-image-1898" style="width:696px;height:auto" title="Musicfy AI Honest Review: Is it really good? 7" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-3.png 696w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-3-219x300.png 219w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-3-360x492.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-3-545x745.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" /></figure>



<p>You can check out the examples or even modify them. We&#8217;ve used the prompt given in the screenshot.</p>



<p>If you want, you can be specific about the instrument and use something like: &#8220;create an enegertic and futuristic <strong>piano</strong> jingle for an ai tool review website that has a fade in, more energetic part and fade out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can give it musical liberty and only specify the instrument to be used:<br>&#8220;create an energetic drum solo&#8221;.</p>



<p class="has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Result: <strong>Pretty happy with the output.</strong> Very soon we&#8217;ll put up a video on our YouTube channel showcasing these! <strong>Works as advertised!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Voice conversion tested: could be better</h2>



<p>For the voice conversion we&#8217;ve used the following videos to test out voice conversion.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><a href="https://aireviewguys.com/musicfy-ai-review/"><img decoding="async" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-youtube-lyte/lyteCache.php?origThumbUrl=%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fr5QCKmIdheA%2Fhqdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube Video" title="Musicfy AI Honest Review: Is it really good? 8"></a><br /><br /><figcaption>The acapella above gave better results.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Using the video above as the original vocal didn&#8217;t yield the best results &#8211; as it had instruments in it.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-background">Result: <strong>Output quality varies. </strong>There were bits where the vocal was nearly perfect but some pieces were robotic through the end.<br>Very soon we&#8217;ll put up a video on our YouTube channel showcasing these!</p>
