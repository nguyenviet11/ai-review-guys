]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1. Choosing Your Music Style</h2>



<p>Begin by deciding the type of song you want to create. It’s important to choose <strong>one or two music styles</strong> that align with the mood or message of your song. </p>



<p class="has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Sticking to just a couple of styles keeps the process straightforward and <strong>prevents the song from becoming too chaotic or confusing.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Example prompt:</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;90s American rock song with strong female vocals. The song should convey that life can be tough, but it&#8217;s important to keep hope alive.&#8221;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">2. Generating Lyrics</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">a. Generate Initial Lyrics</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Generate Lyrics</strong>: Start by using the &#8220;Generate Lyrics&#8221; feature. <strong>Input your chosen music style and any specific themes or ideas you want the song to convey. </strong>This will give you a basic structure for your song&#8217;s lyrics.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">b. Reviewing and Refining the Lyrics</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Review the Lyrics</strong>: Once the lyrics are generated, carefully read through them. Look out for any sections that don’t quite make sense or don’t align with the intended message.</li>



<li><strong>Make Adjustments</strong>: Edit any awkward phrases or words to ensure that the lyrics flow naturally and convey the desired emotion or story.</li>
</ul>



<p>You can make use of the elements mentioned below.</p>



<p><strong>Verse Example</strong>:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>&#91;Verse] Life can knock you down, streets are cold in this old town. But the fire inside still burns bright, guiding you through the darkest night.</code></code></pre>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p><strong>Chorus Example</strong>:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>&#91;Chorus] Stand tall, never back down. Even when the world pushes you around. Stand tall, don’t lose your ground. You’ve got the strength, you’ll be found.</code></code></pre>



<p><strong>Bridge Example</strong>:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>&#91;Bridge] The road is long, but you’re not alone. Keep pushing forward, you’ll find your home. Through the storm, through the rain, you’ll rise above, you’ll break the chain.</code></code></pre>



<p><strong>Outro Example</strong>:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>&#91;Outro] The sun will rise again, and you’ll find your way. Just keep the faith, brighter days will come your way.</code></code></pre>



<p>These parentheses prompts are designed to guide the song&#8217;s structure and mood, aligning it with the intended message and style.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">c. Help from ChatGPT &amp; Custom GPTs</h3>



<p class="has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">An easy and kind of automated way for this is to use a <a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-iOb9rJXPe-lyric-composer-for-suno" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CustomGPT</a> dedicated to it. </p>



<p>Tell it how it should modify the lyrics and it will do the trick.</p>



<p>Some prompts you can use are: </p>



<p>-simply the lyrics<br>-make it more emotional<br>-make it fitting to 90s pop<br>-remove half of it that doesn&#8217;t ryhme</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">d. Customizing the Melody (with command)</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Adjust the Melody</strong>: If the generated melody doesn’t quite fit the lyrics or the mood of the song, make necessary adjustments. Ensure that the melody complements the lyrics and enhances the overall feel of the song.</li>
</ul>



<p>example:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-code"><code><code>&#91;FILLER MELODY - Blues]</code></code></pre>



<p>You can customise and sprinkle melody commands like above before / after each element of your song&#8217;s lyrics. </p>



<p>N.B. Not everytime generated song will reflect this, ratio is about 50 percent for now.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">3. Finalizing the Song</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">a. Enhancing with AI Tools</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Optional Refinement</strong>: If you want to polish the lyrics further, consider using an AI tool to automatically refine them. This can help make the lyrics more poetic or suitable for your song&#8217;s style. After the AI refines the lyrics, review the changes and incorporate them into your song.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">b. Creating the Final Song</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Create the Song</strong>: Once you&#8217;re satisfied with the lyrics and melody, use the &#8220;Create&#8221; feature to produce the final version of your song. This will combine all the elements into a complete piece.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">4. Tips for Better Results</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">a. Keeping It Simple</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Limit Your Styles</strong>: While it might be tempting to experiment with multiple music styles, it&#8217;s usually best to stick to one or two. This makes it easier to create a cohesive song.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">b. Reviewing and Reflecting</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Listen and Take a Break</strong>: After creating a few versions of your song, give yourself a break before making a final decision. Listening with fresh ears can help you catch things you might have missed before.</li>



<li><strong>Re-evaluate If Necessary</strong>: If, after multiple attempts, the song still doesn’t feel right, don’t hesitate to go back to the drawing board. Revisit the lyrics and style choices, and try the process again to see if a different approach yields better results.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">5. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">a. Lyrics Not Matching the Mood</h3>



<p>If the lyrics generated aren’t capturing the mood you want, consider tweaking the input prompts. Be more specific about the emotions, themes, or style you want the lyrics to reflect.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">b. Melody Not Fitting</h3>



<p>Sometimes the melody may not match the lyrics well. In this case, experiment with different melodies or try adjusting the rhythm and tempo to better fit the words.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">c. Balancing Creativity and Structure</h3>



<p>Remember that while it’s important to be creative, maintaining a clear structure in your song is key. Make sure each verse, chorus, and bridge logically flows into the next, creating a seamless musical experience.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">6. Repeating the Process for Perfection</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">a. Create Multiple Versions</h3>



<p>Don’t be afraid to create several versions of your song. Each iteration can bring you closer to the perfect version. Experiment with different styles, lyrics, and melodies to see what works best.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">b. Final Evaluation</h3>



<p>After completing several versions, take some time to evaluate them all. Listen to each version carefully, noting what you like and what doesn’t work. This reflection will help you make the final tweaks needed to perfect your song.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">c. Continuous Improvement</h3>



<p>Even after finalizing your song, you may find areas that could be improved. Songwriting is an ongoing process, and there’s always room for refinement. Keep experimenting and improving your skills with each new song you create.</p>

<p>Make a prompt: theme, style and vocal preferences.</p>

<p>Processing two alternatives at a time.</p>



<p class="has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">These 2 songs will have same lyrics but slightly different styles.</p>



<p><a href="https://suno.com/song/6e4cc422-030d-42f7-a3e7-c478eeb010ff" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nu metal version here.</a> Angry panda is angry for sure. Let&#8217;s see what happens when i prompt for &#8220;positive vibes&#8221;. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="698" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4.png" alt="image 4" class="wp-image-2611" style="width:432px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 6" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4.png 702w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4-300x298.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4-150x150.png 150w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4-360x358.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-4-545x542.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://suno.com/song/d5f107fc-c52e-4716-b026-bc7c472bb6b5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vibe is more positive</a> for sure, lyrics &#8211; not so sure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does &#8220;Get Stems&#8221; do on Suno AI?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="452" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-1024x452.png" alt="image 5" class="wp-image-2612" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 7" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-1024x452.png 1024w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-300x132.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-768x339.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-360x159.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5-545x241.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5.png 1314w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>It gives you a <strong>vocal only</strong> and (nearly)<strong> full instrumental</strong> version of the song selected. There may be traces of back vocals but makes it easier to rework on your stuff.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What does &#8220;Extend&#8221; do on Suno AI?</h2>



<p>It lets you alter the song from a timestamp of your choice. Let&#8217;s demonstrate it on Pandomonium Defenders.</p>



<p>I think first minute is all cool but it kind of gets repetitive after that. I will ask it to shift the style into traditional Chinese music.</p>



<p>To do this, I click on three dots and go for extend.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="741" height="1024" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-6-741x1024.png" alt="image 6" class="wp-image-2613" style="width:480px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 8" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-6-741x1024.png 741w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-6-217x300.png 217w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-6-360x497.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-6-545x753.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-6.png 750w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 741px) 100vw, 741px" /></figure>



<p>It will get the extend command screen on left hand side.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="659" height="1024" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-7-659x1024.png" alt="image 7" class="wp-image-2614" style="width:414px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 9" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-7-659x1024.png 659w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-7-193x300.png 193w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-7-360x560.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-7-545x847.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-7.png 718w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 659px) 100vw, 659px" /></figure>



<p>Top one is for your lyrics. I auto-generated a new set.</p>



<p>Second one for the style of your music, I tried to describe what I want.</p>



<p class="has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background">Enter a title that helps you remember later what you tried to achieve. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="702" height="644" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-8.png" alt="image 8" class="wp-image-2615" style="width:339px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 10" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-8.png 702w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-8-300x275.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-8-360x330.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-8-545x500.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px" /></figure>



<p>Most importantly, mark where you want the extend to start from. I&#8217;m happy with first minute so it is &#8220;from 0.59 seconds.&#8221; Now, hit the extend button.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How to merge extend and original song together?</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="502" height="868" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-9.png" alt="image 9" class="wp-image-2616" style="width:258px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 11" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-9.png 502w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-9-174x300.png 174w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-9-360x622.png 360w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 502px) 100vw, 502px" /></figure>



<p>Threee dots -&gt; Reuse prompt.</p>



<p>Now the final version is different from 00:59 on (in the direction we extended it).</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="902" height="526" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-10.png" alt="image 10" class="wp-image-2617" style="width:523px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 12" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-10.png 902w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-10-300x175.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-10-768x448.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-10-360x210.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-10-545x318.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px" /></figure>



<p>See the original, extend and Full song.</p>



<p><a href="https://suno.com/song/6bfa9875-13b6-4eb9-94a4-c473e79557e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The final song</a> has until 00:59 from the first one, rest is from the second one (extend).</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-background">N.B. Maybe it&#8217;s my fault but I don&#8217;t think the style change is successful. Lyrics-wise, it is succesfull.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Experiment: Children song on how fun video games are &#8211; with a twist.</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s give it one more shot. Idea is that we have a song about talking on video games but I&#8217;ll extend it to start talking about why we should do chores in the house and do our homework (sneaky) from 1:00.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll attempt again to change the style.</p>



<p><a href="https://suno.com/song/1a472e33-32f6-4cec-a196-68eb8b0badef" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Original</a> &#8211; button smash till dawn. Okayy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="986" height="188" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11.png" alt="image 11" class="wp-image-2618" style="width:505px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 13" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11.png 986w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11-300x57.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11-768x146.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11-360x69.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-11-545x104.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 986px) 100vw, 986px" /></figure>



<p>Let&#8217;s extend for chores.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="728" height="880" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-12.png" alt="image 12" class="wp-image-2619" style="width:418px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 14" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-12.png 728w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-12-248x300.png 248w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-12-360x435.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-12-545x659.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 728px) 100vw, 728px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="746" height="826" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-13.png" alt="image 13" class="wp-image-2620" style="width:421px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 15" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-13.png 746w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-13-271x300.png 271w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-13-360x399.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-13-545x603.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px" /></figure>



<p>From 0:48 it will start talking about chores if this works. <a href="https://suno.com/song/9c55225b-fe05-442e-89ac-de7aee41a896" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It does!</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="938" height="530" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-14.png" alt="image 14" class="wp-image-2621" style="width:423px;height:auto" title="Suno AI Explained: Stems, Extend, Get Full Song Functions 16" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-14.png 938w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-14-300x170.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-14-768x434.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-14-360x203.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-14-545x308.png 545w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 938px) 100vw, 938px" /></figure>



<p>Again, fails to change the style.</p>



<p class="has-luminous-vivid-amber-background-color has-background">To sum up, extend work well on changing lyrics but has limited to no power on the music style.</p>
