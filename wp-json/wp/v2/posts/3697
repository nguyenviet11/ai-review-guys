This limitation ensures efficient resource usage and consistent performance for all users, whether on Free, Plus, or Pro plans.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Is GPT-4o Good Enough for Your Needs?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not being as advanced as o1, GPT-4o provides robust capabilities for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Content creation<\/strong>: Generating high-quality text for various purposes.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Customer support<\/strong>: Delivering tailored, reliable responses.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Educational tools<\/strong>: Assisting in structured learning and tutoring.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can You Switch CustomGPTs to o1?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-blush-light-purple-gradient-background has-background\">No, CustomGPTs are restricted to GPT-4o at this time. Even Pro users cannot configure CustomGPTs to use o1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">For Advanced Needs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your tasks require the enhanced reasoning and precision of o1, use Pro plan features directly instead of CustomGPTs. This approach ensures access to o1\u2019s full capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ChatGPT Pro: Will Your GPTs (CustomGPTs) Use o1 or 4o?<\/h1>\n\n\n\n<p>CustomGPTs currently run on <strong>GPT-4o<\/strong>, not o1, regardless of your subscription plan. Even Pro users cannot configure CustomGPTs to use the o1 model. This distinction is essential for anyone considering ChatGPT Pro for advanced CustomGPT capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Are CustomGPTs Restricted to GPT-4o?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CustomGPTs rely on GPT-4o to maintain consistency and scalability for all users, from Free to Pro plans. This ensures equitable access without overloading resources. While GPT-4o is a robust model, it is designed to be more resource-efficient than o1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For official guidance on building CustomGPTs, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/help.openai.com\/en\/articles\/8554397-creating-a-gpt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Creating a GPT<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Can GPT-4o Handle?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>GPT-4o delivers reliable performance for a variety of use cases:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Text creation<\/strong>: Crafting emails, blog posts, or scripts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Problem-solving<\/strong>: Addressing customer inquiries or educational queries.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Scalable usage<\/strong>: Balancing quality with computational efficiency.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Although not as advanced as o1, GPT-4o is highly capable for most general tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can You Upgrade CustomGPTs to o1?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, CustomGPTs cannot currently use o1. Even with Pro access, the tools used to build and run CustomGPTs are limited to GPT-4o. For tasks requiring o1\u2019s advanced reasoning, you\u2019ll need to utilize the Pro plan\u2019s direct access to the o1 model outside of CustomGPTs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Get the Most Out of CustomGPTs on GPT-4o<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Be specific with instructions<\/strong><br>Customize your GPT\u2019s behavior and scope by detailing its instructions in the Configure tab.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Leverage contextual data<\/strong><br>Upload up to 20 files to enhance your GPT\u2019s understanding of specialized topics or datasets.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enable optional features<\/strong><br>Utilize web browsing, DALL\u00b7E image generation, and advanced data analysis if supported by your plan.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Guide users with prompts<\/strong><br>Include example prompts to help users interact effectively with your CustomGPT.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Set realistic expectations<\/strong><br>Understand that GPT-4o has limitations compared to o1 and tailor your use cases accordingly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Questions About CustomGPTs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I Use CustomGPTs for Advanced Business Applications?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, but only for tasks within GPT-4o\u2019s capabilities.
