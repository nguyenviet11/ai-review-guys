Here\u2019s how to use it:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Go to the Briefly AI website and sign up for free.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Install the Chrome extension and open Google Meet.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click \u201cStart Transcript\u201d during a meeting to begin recording.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>After the call, receive an AI summary via email or Slack.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Edit the summary and sync it to your CRM.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Easy Is It to Set Up and Use Briefly AI?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Signing Up:<\/strong><br>Signing up takes minutes. Visit the website, enter your email, and install the Chrome extension. No credit card is needed for the Free plan.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Interface and Usability:<\/strong><br>The dashboard is simple but cluttered with options. Key features like transcriptions are easy to start, but finding settings for CRM integration requires clicking through menus. The \u201cSummaries\u201d tab shows past meetings, but filtering them by date or keyword isn\u2019t possible. Users might struggle to locate the Slack notification toggle, which is buried under \u201cAccount Settings.\u201d The lack of a search bar makes navigating older transcripts tedious. However, tooltips explain most buttons, helping new users learn basics quickly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Using Briefly AI<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Use these tips to get the most from Briefly AI:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enable Slack Notifications:<\/strong> Turn this on in settings to get summaries faster. This avoids missing updates in a crowded inbox.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check Browser Storage:<\/strong> Clear cache only if necessary, as it deletes transcripts. Export important summaries manually.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Edit Summaries Before CRM Sync:<\/strong> Fix errors or add notes to ensure CRM data stays accurate.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conclusion: Is Briefly AI the Best Choice for Automating Meetings?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefly AI excels for Google Meet users needing automatic transcriptions and summaries. Its free plan is a strong starting point, and Pro\/Team plans add crucial CRM features. However, the lack of Zoom\/Microsoft Teams support limits broader use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool\u2019s local data storage is a privacy win but risks data loss. Teams relying on Slack or HubSpot will benefit, but those using other CRMs must wait for updates.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Briefly AI is best for small to mid-sized teams using Google Meet who value automated summaries over advanced integrations. Choose it if your workflow fits its current limits and budget.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Briefly AI promises to automate meeting transcriptions and summaries using AI.
