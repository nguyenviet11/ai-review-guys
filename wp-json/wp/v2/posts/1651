This typically includes information on the length of the trial, any restrictions on features or usage during the trial period, and conditions under which the trial can be converted into a paid subscription. <strong>This is 5 days as we are writing this article. <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Terms of Service, it is mentioned that <strong>users are responsible for properly cancelling their accounts. <\/strong>This implies that for the free trial, just like with a paid subscription, users need to follow the prescribed process for cancellation to avoid automatic conversion into a paid plan. However, the document does not provide explicit details on the process for cancelling a free trial. Therefore, users would typically need to navigate to their account settings on the Article Forge website to initiate the cancellation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background\">It&#8217;s also important to remember that Article Forge offers a <a href=\"https:\/\/aireviewguys.com\/does-article-forge-refund-as-promised\/\">30-Day No Risk Money Back Guarantee.<\/a> This guarantee allows users who have transitioned from a free trial to a paid subscription to request a full refund within 30 days if the service does not meet their expectations. To be eligible for this refund, users should have created <strong>less than ten articles<\/strong> using Article Forge.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Steps to Cancel the Free Trial<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Accessing Your Account Settings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin the cancellation process, you will need to log into your Article Forge account. Once logged in, navigate to the account settings area. This section typically contains your subscription details, including information about your current plan and the free trial status. It&#8217;s important to locate the section that specifically deals with subscription management, as this is where you&#8217;ll find options to modify or cancel your subscription.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Navigating the Cancellation Process<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the account settings, look for an option that says &#8216;Cancel Subscription&#8217; or something similar (in case this is updated while you are reading this). Upon selecting this option, you might be prompted to answer a few questions or provide feedback about why you&#8217;re cancelling the trial. It&#8217;s important to follow through these steps as they are part of the cancellation process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve completed the necessary steps and confirmed your cancellation, the free trial will be set to end. You should receive a confirmation message or email from Article Forge acknowledging the cancellation of the free trial. This confirmation is important as it serves as your proof that the trial has been successfully cancelled, preventing any unintended charges or automatic transition into a paid subscription.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, the process of cancellation should be completed before the free trial period expires. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-pale-pink-background-color has-background\">Failing to cancel in time could result in the automatic conversion of the free trial into a paid subscription, leading to charges based on the plan associated with the trial. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, it&#8217;s crucial to be mindful of the trial end date and ensure that the cancellation is completed in a timely manner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">After Cancellation: What to Expect<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Confirmation and Account Status<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After successfully cancelling the Article Forge free trial, you should expect to receive a <strong>confirmation<\/strong>, typically via email, that acknowledges the cancellation. This confirmation is crucial as it serves as a record of your action. It&#8217;s advisable to keep this email for future reference in case there are any discrepancies or issues. Additionally, your account status on the Article Forge platform will be updated to reflect that the free trial has been cancelled and that you are no longer subscribed to their services.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Post-Cancellation Access and Data Handling<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the free trial is cancelled, access to the features provided by Article Forge during the trial period will typically cease. This means you will no longer be able to use the tool to generate new content. However, it&#8217;s important to check the Terms of Service or contact customer support for specific information regarding access to any content or data created during the trial period. Some services may allow you to access and export your data, while others may restrict access post-cancellation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it&#8217;s important to understand how your data will be handled after cancellation. The Terms of Service should provide details on data retention or deletion policies following the end of a free trial. Understanding these policies is essential, especially if you have concerns about the privacy and security of any data you entered into the system during the trial.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After cancelling the Article Forge free trial, ensure that you receive a confirmation of cancellation, understand the changes in account access and features, and are aware of how your data will be managed. These steps are important to ensure a smooth transition out of the free trial without any unexpected issues.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Understanding the Free Trial Terms To cancel the Article Forge free trial effectively, it&#8217;s important to first understand the terms associated with the trial period.
