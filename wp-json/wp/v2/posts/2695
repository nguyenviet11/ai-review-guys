Choosing Your Music Style<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Begin by deciding the type of song you want to create. It\u2019s important to choose <strong>one or two music styles<\/strong> that align with the mood or message of your song. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background\">Sticking to just a couple of styles keeps the process straightforward and <strong>prevents the song from becoming too chaotic or confusing.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example prompt:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;90s American rock song with strong female vocals. The song should convey that life can be tough, but it&#8217;s important to keep hope alive.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Generating Lyrics<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">a. Generate Initial Lyrics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Generate Lyrics<\/strong>: Start by using the &#8220;Generate Lyrics&#8221; feature. <strong>Input your chosen music style and any specific themes or ideas you want the song to convey. <\/strong>This will give you a basic structure for your song&#8217;s lyrics.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">b. Reviewing and Refining the Lyrics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Review the Lyrics<\/strong>: Once the lyrics are generated, carefully read through them. Look out for any sections that don\u2019t quite make sense or don\u2019t align with the intended message.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Make Adjustments<\/strong>: Edit any awkward phrases or words to ensure that the lyrics flow naturally and convey the desired emotion or story.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can make use of the elements mentioned below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verse Example<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>&#91;Verse] Life can knock you down, streets are cold in this old town. But the fire inside still burns bright, guiding you through the darkest night.<\/code><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chorus Example<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>&#91;Chorus] Stand tall, never back down. Even when the world pushes you around. Stand tall, don\u2019t lose your ground. You\u2019ve got the strength, you\u2019ll be found.<\/code><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bridge Example<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>&#91;Bridge] The road is long, but you\u2019re not alone. Keep pushing forward, you\u2019ll find your home. Through the storm, through the rain, you\u2019ll rise above, you\u2019ll break the chain.<\/code><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outro Example<\/strong>:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>&#91;Outro] The sun will rise again, and you\u2019ll find your way. Just keep the faith, brighter days will come your way.<\/code><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>These parentheses prompts are designed to guide the song&#8217;s structure and mood, aligning it with the intended message and style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">c. Help from ChatGPT &amp; Custom GPTs<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-light-green-cyan-background-color has-background\">An easy and kind of automated way for this is to use a <a href=\"https:\/\/chatgpt.com\/g\/g-iOb9rJXPe-lyric-composer-for-suno\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CustomGPT<\/a> dedicated to it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell it how it should modify the lyrics and it will do the trick.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some prompts you can use are: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>-simply the lyrics<br>-make it more emotional<br>-make it fitting to 90s pop<br>-remove half of it that doesn&#8217;t ryhme<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">d. Customizing the Melody (with command)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Adjust the Melody<\/strong>: If the generated melody doesn\u2019t quite fit the lyrics or the mood of the song, make necessary adjustments. Ensure that the melody complements the lyrics and enhances the overall feel of the song.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code><code>&#91;FILLER MELODY - Blues]<\/code><\/code><\/pre>\n\n\n\n<p>You can customise and sprinkle melody commands like above before \/ after each element of your song&#8217;s lyrics. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>N.B. Not everytime generated song will reflect this, ratio is about 50 percent for now.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Finalizing the Song<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">a. Enhancing with AI Tools<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Optional Refinement<\/strong>: If you want to polish the lyrics further, consider using an AI tool to automatically refine them. This can help make the lyrics more poetic or suitable for your song&#8217;s style. After the AI refines the lyrics, review the changes and incorporate them into your song.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">b. Creating the Final Song<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Create the Song<\/strong>: Once you&#8217;re satisfied with the lyrics and melody, use the &#8220;Create&#8221; feature to produce the final version of your song. This will combine all the elements into a complete piece.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Tips for Better Results<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">a. Keeping It Simple<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Limit Your Styles<\/strong>: While it might be tempting to experiment with multiple music styles, it&#8217;s usually best to stick to one or two. This makes it easier to create a cohesive song.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">b. Reviewing and Reflecting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Listen and Take a Break<\/strong>: After creating a few versions of your song, give yourself a break before making a final decision. Listening with fresh ears can help you catch things you might have missed before.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Re-evaluate If Necessary<\/strong>: If, after multiple attempts, the song still doesn\u2019t feel right, don\u2019t hesitate to go back to the drawing board. Revisit the lyrics and style choices, and try the process again to see if a different approach yields better results.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Troubleshooting Common Issues<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">a. Lyrics Not Matching the Mood<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the lyrics generated aren\u2019t capturing the mood you want, consider tweaking the input prompts. Be more specific about the emotions, themes, or style you want the lyrics to reflect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">b. Melody Not Fitting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes the melody may not match the lyrics well. In this case, experiment with different melodies or try adjusting the rhythm and tempo to better fit the words.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">c. Balancing Creativity and Structure<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that while it\u2019s important to be creative, maintaining a clear structure in your song is key. Make sure each verse, chorus, and bridge logically flows into the next, creating a seamless musical experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Repeating the Process for Perfection<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">a. Create Multiple Versions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to create several versions of your song. Each iteration can bring you closer to the perfect version. Experiment with different styles, lyrics, and melodies to see what works best.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">b. Final Evaluation<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing several versions, take some time to evaluate them all. Listen to each version carefully, noting what you like and what doesn\u2019t work. This reflection will help you make the final tweaks needed to perfect your song.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">c. Continuous Improvement<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even after finalizing your song, you may find areas that could be improved. Songwriting is an ongoing process, and there\u2019s always room for refinement. Keep experimenting and improving your skills with each new song you create.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>1.
