This policy is specifically designed to allow users to try <a href=\"https:\/\/aireviewguys.com\/article-forge-review\/\">Article Forge<\/a> with the assurance of receiving a refund if the service does not meet their expectations. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this guarantee, users who create less than ten articles and find that Article Forge doesn&#8217;t live up to their expectations can contact the company for a no-hassle, no-questions-asked refund.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this 30-day guarantee is an exception to the general rule in the Terms of Service, which states that all payments are nonrefundable, and Glimpse.ai (the company behind Article Forge) does not provide refunds for lack of usage or dissatisfaction. The 30-Day No Risk Money Back Guarantee is a distinct offer that provides users with a specific window of opportunity to assess the tool and decide whether it meets their needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-pale-pink-background-color has-background\">Article Forge does refund as promised under the conditions of the 30-Day No Risk Money Back Guarantee, provided the user&#8217;s usage falls within the specified parameters of <strong>creating less than ten articles<\/strong> and expressing dissatisfaction <strong>within the 30-day period.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When refunds are not given?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Refunds are not given by Article Forge in several specific circumstances as outlined in their Terms of Service:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Nonrefundable Payments<\/strong>: Generally, all payments to Article Forge are nonrefundable. This includes scenarios where a user might want to cancel their subscription due to lack of usage or dissatisfaction with the service. The Terms of Service clearly state that Glimpse.ai, the company behind Article Forge, does not provide refunds for these reasons.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Partial Service and Plan Downgrades<\/strong>: There are no refunds or credits available for partial months of service, plan downgrades, or months unused if a user decides to close their account before the end of their subscription period. This means if you choose to stop using the service mid-subscription or switch to a cheaper plan, you won&#8217;t get a refund for the time or service level not used.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cancellation and Account Deletion<\/strong>: Users are responsible for properly cancelling their accounts. Cancellation can be done at any time by the user, but it must be done through the user&#8217;s account or PayPal to cancel future charges for the service. It&#8217;s important to note that any method of communication other than electing to cancel your subscription plan inside your selected payment method is not considered a valid form of cancellation. Upon cancellation, all content associated with the account is immediately deleted from the Service, and there are no refunds for this deletion.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"4\">\n<li><strong>Reprocessing Fees<\/strong>: If there are fees incurred due to the reprocessing of the Payment Method, whether these are incurred by the user or Glimpse.ai, the user is immediately responsible for reimbursing these fees. This suggests that any additional costs associated with payment processing issues are not eligible for refunds.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>No Entitlement to Future Discounts or Refunds<\/strong>: Even if Glimpse.ai provides a discount, credit, or refund in certain instances, this does not entitle the user or any third party to expect or receive similar discounts, credits, or refunds in the future. The provision of these benefits in one instance does not obligate Glimpse.ai to offer them again under similar or different circumstances.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Automatic Renewal of Subscriptions<\/strong>: All of Article Forge&#8217;s paid subscription plans use recurring billing and will automatically renew at the end of the subscription period until cancelled by the user. This means if the user does not cancel the subscription before the renewal, they are liable for the charges of the next billing cycle, and these charges are not refundable.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding these terms can help avoid unexpected costs and clarify situations where refunds are not an option.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Understanding Article Forge&#8217;s Refund Policy Article Forge does offer a 30-Day No Risk Money Back Guarantee.
