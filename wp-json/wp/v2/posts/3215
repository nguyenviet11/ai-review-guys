This helps the AI give more accurate and useful answers.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use the image feature wisely<\/strong> \u2013 You only get 30 image credits a month, so plan your prompts carefully. This ensures you don&#8217;t waste credits on unnecessary images.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reset conversations when needed<\/strong> \u2013 If the AI gets confused, use the <strong>!reset<\/strong> command to start fresh.

Its simplicity is great for people who don\u2019t want to deal with complicated apps or platforms. The AI responds well to everyday questions and is suitable for various tasks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, <strong>the tool has some limits<\/strong>, like the delay between messages and the cap on image generation. These can be frustrating for users who need quick responses or want to create many images. Also, it runs on a pretty old GPT model (GPT 3.5) but for casual use and personal projects, it\u2019s still a good option at a low cost.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-blush-light-purple-gradient-background has-background\"><strong>In the end, whether God In A Box is the right tool for you depends on what you need, your budget, and your expectations.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We reviewed God In A Box and looked at its features, pros and cons, pricing, and how easy it is to use so you can decide if this tool is good and suitable for your needs.
