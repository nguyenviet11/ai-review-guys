<li><strong>Team:</strong> Adds license management and team billing. Suitable for small teams coordinating multiple users.</li>



<li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Custom solutions for large companies. Includes all features and tailored support.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Free plan is good for casual users. Pro fits freelancers, while Team helps growing teams. Enterprise targets large organizations needing specialized tools.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does Briefly AI Offer a Free Trial?</h3>



<p>Yes, Briefly AI’s Free plan requires no credit card and includes 5 AI summaries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Briefly AI?</h2>



<p>Briefly AI is a Chrome extension that transcribes Google Meet calls and generates AI summaries. It helps teams automate post-meeting tasks like updating CRMs and sending follow-up emails.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Briefly AI: Key Features and Functionalities</h2>



<p>Briefly AI focuses on turning meetings into actionable steps. Its features aim to cut manual work and keep teams aligned.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Automatic Transcriptions:</strong> Captures every word in real-time during meetings.</li>



<li><strong>AI Summaries:</strong> Highlights key points and action items after calls.</li>



<li><strong>Email/Slack Updates:</strong> Sends summaries directly to your inbox or Slack channel.</li>



<li><strong>CRM Integration:</strong> Saves data to HubSpot or Salesforce (planned) automatically.</li>



<li><strong>Chrome Extension:</strong> Works seamlessly within Google Meet.</li>



<li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> Keeps transcripts in your browser for privacy.</li>



<li><strong>Custom CRM Fields:</strong> Lets you edit summaries before syncing.</li>



<li><strong>Health Scores:</strong> Tracks customer sentiment post-call.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features help managers, salespeople, and customer success teams stay organized. The tool is best for those using Google Meet daily and needing automated documentation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Does Briefly AI Work?</h3>



<p>Briefly AI works as a Chrome extension for Google Meet. Here’s how to use it:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Go to the Briefly AI website and sign up for free.</li>



<li>Install the Chrome extension and open Google Meet.</li>



<li>Click “Start Transcript” during a meeting to begin recording.</li>



<li>After the call, receive an AI summary via email or Slack.</li>



<li>Edit the summary and sync it to your CRM.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Easy Is It to Set Up and Use Briefly AI?</h3>



<p><strong>Signing Up:</strong><br>Signing up takes minutes. Visit the website, enter your email, and install the Chrome extension. No credit card is needed for the Free plan.</p>



<p><strong>Interface and Usability:</strong><br>The dashboard is simple but cluttered with options. Key features like transcriptions are easy to start, but finding settings for CRM integration requires clicking through menus. The “Summaries” tab shows past meetings, but filtering them by date or keyword isn’t possible. Users might struggle to locate the Slack notification toggle, which is buried under “Account Settings.” The lack of a search bar makes navigating older transcripts tedious. However, tooltips explain most buttons, helping new users learn basics quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Using Briefly AI</h3>



<p>Use these tips to get the most from Briefly AI:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enable Slack Notifications:</strong> Turn this on in settings to get summaries faster. This avoids missing updates in a crowded inbox.</li>



<li><strong>Check Browser Storage:</strong> Clear cache only if necessary, as it deletes transcripts. Export important summaries manually.</li>



<li><strong>Edit Summaries Before CRM Sync:</strong> Fix errors or add notes to ensure CRM data stays accurate.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: Is Briefly AI the Best Choice for Automating Meetings?</h2>



<p>Briefly AI excels for Google Meet users needing automatic transcriptions and summaries. Its free plan is a strong starting point, and Pro/Team plans add crucial CRM features. However, the lack of Zoom/Microsoft Teams support limits broader use.</p>



<p>The tool’s local data storage is a privacy win but risks data loss. Teams relying on Slack or HubSpot will benefit, but those using other CRMs must wait for updates.</p>



<p>Briefly AI is best for small to mid-sized teams using Google Meet who value automated summaries over advanced integrations. Choose it if your workflow fits its current limits and budget.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does Magnific AI Offer a Free Trial?</h3>



<p>Magnific AI does not offer a free trial. Users must purchase a plan to access the tool.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Magnific AI?</h2>



<p>Magnific AI is an AI tool that upscales, transforms, or generates images by adding details using generative AI. Users guide the process with text prompts and sliders like Creativity to control how much the AI “hallucinates” new elements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magnific AI: Key Features and Functionalities</h2>



<p>Magnific AI focuses on turning low-quality images into high-res versions with AI-generated details. Below are its main features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>High-resolution upscaling:</strong> Increase image size up to 10x without losing quality.</li>



<li><strong>Creativity slider:</strong> Control how much new detail the AI adds.</li>



<li><strong>HDR adjustments:</strong> Improve color and contrast for realistic results.</li>



<li><strong>Text prompts:</strong> Describe what details to add (e.g., “more textures on the walls”).</li>



<li><strong>Batch processing:</strong> Upscale multiple images at once.</li>



<li><strong>Resemblance controls:</strong> Keep the original image’s style.</li>



<li><strong>Supports many formats:</strong> Works with portraits, illustrations, 3D renders, etc.</li>



<li><strong>Tutorials:</strong> Guides for beginners to learn the tool.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features help photographers restore old photos and designers create sharp marketing materials. Artists can also use it to add fantasy elements to AI-generated images.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Does Magnific AI Work?</h3>



<p>Magnific AI uses AI to analyze and enhance images based on user inputs. Follow these steps:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Go to the Magnific AI website and log in.</li>



<li>Upload your image or drag it into the workspace.</li>



<li>Adjust sliders like Creativity and HDR to control detail levels.</li>



<li>Enter a text prompt describing desired enhancements (e.g., “add more clouds”).</li>



<li>Click “Upscale” and wait 10-15 minutes for processing.</li>



<li>Download the high-resolution image.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Easy Is It to Set Up and Use Magnific AI?</h3>



<p><strong>Signing up:</strong><br>To use Magnific AI, visit their website, choose a plan, and enter payment details. No free tier exists, so you must pay immediately. After payment, you get access to the dashboard.</p>



<p><strong>Using the interface:</strong><br>The interface has a clean design with sliders and prompts on the main page. Tutorials explain how to adjust settings, but some terms like “Fractality” are unclear without reading guides. The “Creativity” slider is easy to find, but Resemblance controls are hidden in advanced settings. Batch processing requires clicking a separate tab, which new users might miss. Overall, it’s manageable for tech-savvy users but confusing for absolute beginners.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Using Magnific AI</h2>



<p>To get the best results with Magnific AI, follow these tips:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Use high-quality source images:</strong> Blurry inputs may create more artifacts.</li>



<li><strong>Start with low Creativity values:</strong> High values add unrealistic details.</li>



<li><strong>Describe details in prompts:</strong> Specific prompts (e.g., “add wrinkles to the face”) improve accuracy.</li>



<li><strong>Check for artifacts:</strong> Zoom into processed images to spot errors.</li>



<li><strong>Use tutorials:</strong> Watch guides to learn advanced features like batch processing.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: Is Magnific AI the Best Choice for Image Upscaling?</h2>



<p>Magnific AI delivers detailed upscaling for photos, designs, and AI art. Its customization sliders and prompts let users control enhancements, making it better than basic upscalers. However, artifacts can ruin results if settings are too high, and the lack of refunds is a risk.</p>



<p>The pricing is fair for professionals but expensive for casual users. The Pro plan works for freelancers, while studios might need the Enterprise tier.</p>



<p class="has-blush-light-purple-gradient-background has-background">Magnific AI is best for photographers, designers, and AI artists who need high-resolution images and don’t mind paying for quality. Choose it if you value detail control over affordability.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="353" height="666" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-12.png" alt="image 12" class="wp-image-3996" title="Palette FM: Honest Review (Is it really good?) 8" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-12.png 353w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-12-159x300.png 159w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Signing up</strong>: To create an account, enter your email or use Google login. A magic link is sent to your inbox—no password needed. Free users can start immediately without signing up.</p>



<p><strong>Interface and usability</strong>: Palette FM’s interface is clean, with upload buttons and filters clearly labeled. First-time users might struggle with the text editor—typing &#8220;grass&#8221; works better than &#8220;green.&#8221; Browser limits are frustrating: mobile users must use Safari or Chrome, and unsupported browsers block access. The FAQ section helps troubleshoot download issues, but HD credit tracking isn’t visible upfront. Overall, it’s easy for basic tasks but requires patience for advanced tweaks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for using Palette FM</h3>



<p>Improve your Palette FM results with these tips:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Use high-quality originals</strong>: Sharp images reduce blurry colorization.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid color names</strong>: Write &#8220;sky&#8221; instead of &#8220;blue&#8221; for natural results.</li>



<li><strong>Test multiple filters</strong>: Compare &#8220;History&#8221; and &#8220;Vivid&#8221; styles before deciding.</li>



<li><strong>Check previews</strong>: Free low-res downloads let you spot errors before using credits.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: Is Palette FM the best choice for photo colorization?</h2>



<p>Palette FM excels in creating lifelike colors, especially for skin tones and nature scenes. Its text-based customization sets it apart from tools like Adobe Neural Filters, which offer less control. The free plan is generous, and paid credits are affordable for regular users.</p>



<p>However, browser restrictions and credit costs may frustrate professionals needing bulk edits. Competitors like MyHeritage offer mobile apps but lack Palette FM’s precision.</p>



<p class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background">For hobbyists and pros prioritizing quality over bulk workflows, Palette FM is a top choice. Casual users should try the free tier, while photographers may prefer the annual plan for savings. Choose Palette FM if you value detailed customization and realistic results.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pixel Art Style (first trial)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="645" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-1024x645.png" alt="image 12" class="wp-image-3747" title="FlexClip Image Generator: Examples and Tips 30" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-1024x645.png 1024w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-300x189.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-768x484.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-360x227.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-545x343.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12.png 1471w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The <strong>Pixel Art</strong> style attempts to replicate the retro, low-resolution aesthetic commonly seen in classic video games, but it falls short of expectations in this case. Here&#8217;s an analysis:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lack of Pixel Precision</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The images do not fully commit to the pixelated, blocky look typically associated with pixel art. Instead, they lean more towards semi-detailed illustrations.</li>



<li>This reduces the nostalgic, game-like charm expected from the style.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Details and Clarity</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The details, while visible, appear too refined for authentic pixel art. True pixel art relies on simplicity and effective use of limited pixels, which is not achieved here.</li>



<li>The pandas&#8217; textures and bamboo lack the crisp, minimalistic design often seen in traditional pixel art.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Character Design</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pandas themselves still have expressive poses and faces, but they don’t stand out in the way pixel art usually does, where bold outlines and vibrant palettes create a distinct style.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Overall Impact</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>While the images are visually acceptable, they do not align with what one might expect from a tool capable of producing high-quality pixel art. They come across as more digital illustrations rather than retro-inspired designs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This style could use improvements to better capture the essence of pixel art, especially for users seeking to recreate the charm of vintage game visuals.</p>
