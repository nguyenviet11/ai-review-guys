<p>Briefly AI offers four plans: Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise. Here’s a breakdown of monthly costs:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table class="has-fixed-layout"><thead><tr><th><strong>Plan</strong></th><th><strong>Price</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Free</td><td>$0</td></tr><tr><td>Pro</td><td>$15</td></tr><tr><td>Team</td><td>$15 per user</td></tr><tr><td>Enterprise</td><td>Custom</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<li><strong>Enterprise:</strong> Custom solutions for large companies. Includes all features and tailored support.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Free plan is good for casual users. Pro fits freelancers, while Team helps growing teams. Enterprise targets large organizations needing specialized tools.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Does Briefly AI Offer a Free Trial?</h3>



<p>Yes, Briefly AI’s Free plan requires no credit card and includes 5 AI summaries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Briefly AI?</h2>



<p>Briefly AI is a Chrome extension that transcribes Google Meet calls and generates AI summaries. It helps teams automate post-meeting tasks like updating CRMs and sending follow-up emails.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Briefly AI: Key Features and Functionalities</h2>



<p>Briefly AI focuses on turning meetings into actionable steps. Its features aim to cut manual work and keep teams aligned.</p>



<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Automatic Transcriptions:</strong> Captures every word in real-time during meetings.</li>



<li><strong>AI Summaries:</strong> Highlights key points and action items after calls.</li>



<li><strong>Email/Slack Updates:</strong> Sends summaries directly to your inbox or Slack channel.</li>



<li><strong>CRM Integration:</strong> Saves data to HubSpot or Salesforce (planned) automatically.</li>



<li><strong>Chrome Extension:</strong> Works seamlessly within Google Meet.</li>



<li><strong>Local Data Storage:</strong> Keeps transcripts in your browser for privacy.</li>



<li><strong>Custom CRM Fields:</strong> Lets you edit summaries before syncing.</li>



<li><strong>Health Scores:</strong> Tracks customer sentiment post-call.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features help managers, salespeople, and customer success teams stay organized. The tool is best for those using Google Meet daily and needing automated documentation.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Does Briefly AI Work?</h3>



<p>Briefly AI works as a Chrome extension for Google Meet. Here’s how to use it:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Go to the Briefly AI website and sign up for free.</li>



<li>Install the Chrome extension and open Google Meet.</li>



<li>Click “Start Transcript” during a meeting to begin recording.</li>



<li>After the call, receive an AI summary via email or Slack.</li>



<li>Edit the summary and sync it to your CRM.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How Easy Is It to Set Up and Use Briefly AI?</h3>



<p><strong>Signing Up:</strong><br>Signing up takes minutes. Visit the website, enter your email, and install the Chrome extension. No credit card is needed for the Free plan.</p>



<p><strong>Interface and Usability:</strong><br>The dashboard is simple but cluttered with options. Key features like transcriptions are easy to start, but finding settings for CRM integration requires clicking through menus. The “Summaries” tab shows past meetings, but filtering them by date or keyword isn’t possible. Users might struggle to locate the Slack notification toggle, which is buried under “Account Settings.” The lack of a search bar makes navigating older transcripts tedious. However, tooltips explain most buttons, helping new users learn basics quickly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for Using Briefly AI</h3>



<p>Use these tips to get the most from Briefly AI:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Enable Slack Notifications:</strong> Turn this on in settings to get summaries faster. This avoids missing updates in a crowded inbox.</li>



<li><strong>Check Browser Storage:</strong> Clear cache only if necessary, as it deletes transcripts. Export important summaries manually.</li>



<li><strong>Edit Summaries Before CRM Sync:</strong> Fix errors or add notes to ensure CRM data stays accurate.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: Is Briefly AI the Best Choice for Automating Meetings?</h2>



<p>Briefly AI excels for Google Meet users needing automatic transcriptions and summaries. Its free plan is a strong starting point, and Pro/Team plans add crucial CRM features. However, the lack of Zoom/Microsoft Teams support limits broader use.</p>



<p>The tool’s local data storage is a privacy win but risks data loss. Teams relying on Slack or HubSpot will benefit, but those using other CRMs must wait for updates.</p>



<p>Briefly AI is best for small to mid-sized teams using Google Meet who value automated summaries over advanced integrations. Choose it if your workflow fits its current limits and budget.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is Palette FM?</h2>



<p>Palette FM is an AI-powered tool that colorizes black-and-white photos. It uses filters and text prompts to add realistic colors, aiming to simplify photo restoration for everyone.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Palette FM: Key features and functionalities</h2>



<p>Palette FM combines AI precision with user-friendly tools for photo colorization. Here are its standout features:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>21+ color filters</strong>: Apply preset styles like &#8220;Vintage&#8221; or &#8220;Natural&#8221; in one click.</li>



<li><strong>Text-based customization</strong>: Describe elements (e.g., &#8220;ocean,&#8221; &#8220;red dress&#8221;) to guide color choices.</li>



<li><strong>HD downloads</strong>: Get high-resolution images (up to 25 MP) with paid credits.</li>



<li><strong>Browser-based</strong>: No software installs; works on Chrome and Safari.</li>



<li><strong>Batch uploads</strong>: Upload multiple photos at once (bulk processing coming soon).</li>



<li><strong>Pro features</strong>: Faster processing, watermark-free downloads for subscribers.</li>



<li><strong>Free previews</strong>: Test colorizations before spending credits.</li>



<li><strong>Commercial use</strong>: No restrictions on sharing or selling colorized photos.</li>
</ul>



<p>These features help photographers restore old portraits and historians colorize archival images. The text editor is especially useful for artists wanting precise control over moods like &#8220;sunset&#8221; or &#8220;spring morning.&#8221;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How does Palette FM work?</h3>



<p>Palette FM works entirely online, requiring no software downloads. Follow these steps to colorize a photo:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Go to <a href="https://palette.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palette.fm</a> and click &#8220;Start for Free.&#8221;</li>



<li>Upload a black-and-white photo from your device.</li>



<li>Choose a filter or type text descriptions to adjust colors.</li>



<li>Click &#8220;Colorize&#8221; to generate a preview.</li>



<li>Download the low-res version for free or use credits for HD.</li>
</ol>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">How easy is it to set up and use Palette FM?</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="353" height="666" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-12.png" alt="image 12" class="wp-image-3996" title="Palette FM: Honest Review (Is it really good?) 4" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-12.png 353w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-12-159x300.png 159w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /></figure>



<p><strong>Signing up</strong>: To create an account, enter your email or use Google login. A magic link is sent to your inbox—no password needed. Free users can start immediately without signing up.</p>



<p><strong>Interface and usability</strong>: Palette FM’s interface is clean, with upload buttons and filters clearly labeled. First-time users might struggle with the text editor—typing &#8220;grass&#8221; works better than &#8220;green.&#8221; Browser limits are frustrating: mobile users must use Safari or Chrome, and unsupported browsers block access. The FAQ section helps troubleshoot download issues, but HD credit tracking isn’t visible upfront. Overall, it’s easy for basic tasks but requires patience for advanced tweaks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for using Palette FM</h3>



<p>Improve your Palette FM results with these tips:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Use high-quality originals</strong>: Sharp images reduce blurry colorization.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid color names</strong>: Write &#8220;sky&#8221; instead of &#8220;blue&#8221; for natural results.</li>



<li><strong>Test multiple filters</strong>: Compare &#8220;History&#8221; and &#8220;Vivid&#8221; styles before deciding.</li>



<li><strong>Check previews</strong>: Free low-res downloads let you spot errors before using credits.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Conclusion: Is Palette FM the best choice for photo colorization?</h2>



<p>Palette FM excels in creating lifelike colors, especially for skin tones and nature scenes. Its text-based customization sets it apart from tools like Adobe Neural Filters, which offer less control. The free plan is generous, and paid credits are affordable for regular users.</p>



<p>However, browser restrictions and credit costs may frustrate professionals needing bulk edits. Competitors like MyHeritage offer mobile apps but lack Palette FM’s precision.</p>



<p class="has-pale-ocean-gradient-background has-background">For hobbyists and pros prioritizing quality over bulk workflows, Palette FM is a top choice. Casual users should try the free tier, while photographers may prefer the annual plan for savings. Choose Palette FM if you value detailed customization and realistic results.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Setting Up Your Image Generation</h3>



<p>First, locate to FlexClip&#8217;s <a href="https://www.flexclip.com/ai/text-to-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Text-to-Image tool</a> page.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reviewing the Generated Images</h3>



<p>The four images produced by FlexClip&#8217;s Ultra model are stunningly detailed and vibrant. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the output:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Realism and Detail</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Each panda image captures lifelike textures, from the fur&#8217;s softness to the bamboo&#8217;s fine details.</li>



<li>Facial expressions are dynamic and add character, giving each image a unique vibe.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Color and Lighting</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The greenery in the background enhances the natural setting, complementing the panda&#8217;s black-and-white contrast.</li>



<li>Lighting is consistent and well-balanced, which makes the images visually appealing.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Emotion and Creativity</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pandas are expressive—whether they&#8217;re chewing bamboo or displaying playful aggression—making the images engaging for storytelling or creative projects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This showcases how FlexClip&#8217;s Ultra model excels in generating professional-quality images perfect for animations, advertisements, or content creation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Examples generated via different styles</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3D Cartoon Style</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="640" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-8-1024x640.png" alt="image 8" class="wp-image-3741" title="FlexClip Image Generator: Examples and Tips 13" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-8-1024x640.png 1024w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-8-300x187.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-8-768x480.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-8-360x225.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-8-545x341.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-8.png 1490w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Switching to the <strong>3D Cartoon</strong> style with the same prompt brought a more playful and animated twist to the pandas. Here&#8217;s a detailed breakdown:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Artistic Style</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The 3D Cartoon mode adds a fun and vibrant aesthetic, giving the pandas a more exaggerated and cartoon-like appearance while maintaining realistic textures.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Dynamic Expressions</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Each panda has a unique pose and expression, full of personality. Their wide eyes and sharp teeth bring a mischievous yet charming vibe to the images.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Standout Image</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The third image truly stands out. The panda&#8217;s intense focus and playful grip on the bamboo perfectly capture a mix of cuteness and fierce attitude. It’s a great choice for storytelling or lighthearted content.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Clean Backgrounds</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The forest-themed backgrounds remain consistent, keeping the focus on the pandas without distracting elements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This style is ideal for projects needing a lively and character-driven look, such as games, educational materials, or animated videos. The third panda image, in particular, is highly appealing for such uses!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Picasso Style</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="630" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-9-1024x630.png" alt="image 9" class="wp-image-3742" title="FlexClip Image Generator: Examples and Tips 14" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-9-1024x630.png 1024w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-9-300x184.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-9-768x472.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-9-360x221.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-9-545x335.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-9.png 1483w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The <strong>Picasso style</strong> transforms the prompt into bold, abstract representations that resemble cubist art. Here&#8217;s an analysis of this unique artistic choice:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Abstract Aesthetic</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pandas are reimagined with sharp, geometric shapes and vibrant, contrasting colors, staying true to the Picasso-inspired style.</li>



<li>The images prioritize artistic expression over realism, making them visually striking.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Color Palette</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Each panda is composed of a rich, chaotic blend of bright yellows, reds, blues, and greens, creating dynamic and eye-catching visuals.</li>



<li>The strong use of color blocks adds energy and motion to the images.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Expression</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Despite the abstraction, the pandas retain their fierce and playful nature, reflected in their intense eyes and strong postures.</li>



<li>The bamboo is cleverly integrated into the abstract forms, maintaining a connection to the original prompt.</li>

<p>The <strong>Stained Glass</strong> style transforms the pandas into vibrant, mosaic-like creations reminiscent of traditional stained glass art. Here&#8217;s an analysis:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Artistic Design</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The images are crafted with intricate, segmented details that mimic the look of stained glass panels.</li>



<li>The effect adds a timeless and decorative quality to the pandas.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Color and Light</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Bold, vivid colors are framed by dark outlines, typical of stained glass, creating a glowing and dramatic visual impact.</li>



<li>Backgrounds include circular and geometric patterns, enhancing the composition and emphasizing the pandas.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Expressive Characters</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Each panda showcases fierce or playful expressions, blending the elegance of stained glass with the characterful nature of the pandas.</li>



<li>The bamboo details are seamlessly integrated, complementing the overall theme.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This style is perfect for creative projects like art installations, storybook illustrations, or even unique decorative pieces. The stained glass pandas exude both sophistication and charm.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Watercolor Style</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="633" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-11-1024x633.png" alt="image 11" class="wp-image-3744" title="FlexClip Image Generator: Examples and Tips 16" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-11-1024x633.png 1024w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-11-300x185.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-11-768x474.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-11-360x222.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-11-545x337.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-11.png 1520w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The <strong>Watercolor</strong> style delivers charming and soft illustrations that evoke a hand-painted, artistic feel. Here&#8217;s a breakdown of this style:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Artistic Effect</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pandas are rendered with delicate brushstrokes and flowing textures that mimic traditional watercolor painting.</li>



<li>The light blending of colors gives each image a dreamy, whimsical appearance.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Subtle Backgrounds</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Soft, pastel-toned backgrounds blend seamlessly with the pandas, adding depth without drawing attention away from the main subject.</li>



<li>The splashes and gradients of color enhance the naturalistic charm of the style.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Character Design</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Each panda exhibits a mix of cuteness and personality, with their playful poses and expressive eyes.</li>



<li>The details of the bamboo are carefully integrated, maintaining a balance between realism and artistic interpretation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This style is ideal for children’s books, greeting cards, or decorative projects where a gentle, artistic touch is desired. The watercolor pandas are full of warmth and charm, making them perfect for lighthearted, creative applications.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pixel Art Style (first trial)</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="645" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-1024x645.png" alt="image 12" class="wp-image-3747" title="FlexClip Image Generator: Examples and Tips 17" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-1024x645.png 1024w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-300x189.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-768x484.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-360x227.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12-545x343.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-12.png 1471w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The <strong>Pixel Art</strong> style attempts to replicate the retro, low-resolution aesthetic commonly seen in classic video games, but it falls short of expectations in this case. Here&#8217;s an analysis:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lack of Pixel Precision</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The images do not fully commit to the pixelated, blocky look typically associated with pixel art. Instead, they lean more towards semi-detailed illustrations.</li>



<li>This reduces the nostalgic, game-like charm expected from the style.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Details and Clarity</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The details, while visible, appear too refined for authentic pixel art. True pixel art relies on simplicity and effective use of limited pixels, which is not achieved here.</li>



<li>The pandas&#8217; textures and bamboo lack the crisp, minimalistic design often seen in traditional pixel art.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Character Design</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pandas themselves still have expressive poses and faces, but they don’t stand out in the way pixel art usually does, where bold outlines and vibrant palettes create a distinct style.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Overall Impact</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>While the images are visually acceptable, they do not align with what one might expect from a tool capable of producing high-quality pixel art. They come across as more digital illustrations rather than retro-inspired designs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>



<p>This style could use improvements to better capture the essence of pixel art, especially for users seeking to recreate the charm of vintage game visuals.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Pixel Art Style (second trial &#8211; successful)</h3>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Neon Style</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="641" src="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-13-1024x641.png" alt="image 13" class="wp-image-3749" title="FlexClip Image Generator: Examples and Tips 19" srcset="https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-13-1024x641.png 1024w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-13-300x188.png 300w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-13-768x481.png 768w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-13-360x226.png 360w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-13-545x341.png 545w, https://aireviewguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/image-13.png 1475w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The <strong>Neon</strong> style brings a modern, cyberpunk-inspired aesthetic to the pandas, creating a vibrant and futuristic vibe. Here&#8217;s an evaluation:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Lighting and Colors</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The glowing neon highlights in purple, pink, and blue dominate the scene, giving the images a high-energy, nightlife feel.</li>



<li>The contrast between the bright neon elements and the pandas&#8217; dark fur makes the characters stand out dramatically.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Background Atmosphere</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Urban-inspired backdrops, with blurred lights and signage, enhance the cyberpunk mood and add depth to the composition.</li>



<li>The lighting creates a sense of motion and life, mimicking a bustling city setting.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Character Expression</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>The pandas are brought to life with intense, glowing eyes and dynamic poses that fit perfectly with the neon-lit environment.</li>



<li>Their playful yet fierce expressions add a fun contrast to the high-tech aesthetic.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Overall Appeal</strong>:
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>This style is ideal for gaming graphics, promotional materials, or any project looking to combine wildlife with a futuristic edge.</li>



<li>The vivid and eye-catching designs make the pandas unforgettable in this style.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>Prodigy AI operates through a combination of Python scripts, web-based UI, and active learning strategies.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Go to your Python environment</strong> and install Prodigy with the provided package.</li>



<li><strong>Run the command-line interface</strong> using <code>prodigy</code> followed by a recipe (e.g., <code>ner.manual</code>) to start an annotation session.</li>



<li><strong>Load your data</strong> in supported formats (JSONL, CSV, or text files).</li>



<li><strong>Launch the web application</strong> at <code>http://localhost:8080</code> to begin annotating.</li>



<li><strong>Select labels and annotate</strong> examples, accepting or rejecting based on the task requirements.</li>



<li><strong>Save your annotations</strong> and export them using the <code>db-out</code> command for further processing or model training.</li>
</ol>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How easy is it to set up and use Prodigy AI?</h2>



<p>To get started with Prodigy AI, you first need to install it in your Python environment. The installation process is straightforward, but you need a valid license key. You can install it using a simple pip command, and then verify the installation with <code>prodigy stats</code>.</p>



<p>The Prodigy interface is intuitive, designed with speed in mind. You can start a new annotation session through the command line, and then use the web application for actual labeling tasks. The web app is simple and fast, making it easy to highlight entities or select categories.</p>



<p>Navigating the UI is straightforward. The toolbar provides options for saving your work, undoing annotations, and selecting different labels. The app supports hotkeys, making it efficient for large-scale projects. However, users need to be familiar with basic command-line operations to fully utilize the tool.</p>



<p>For complex workflows, users can define custom recipes in Python. This feature, while powerful, may pose a learning curve for non-developers. The flexibility of defining your own data processing and annotation strategies can be a huge advantage but requires Python skills.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for using Prodigy AI</h2>



<p>Prodigy AI is a powerful tool, but maximizing its capabilities requires a strategic approach.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Plan your labeling strategy</strong>: Decide on the labels you need and the format of your data before starting to save time.</li>
